# Heart Disease Prediction Using Decision Trees and Random Forests

## Objective  
Build classification models using Decision Trees and Random Forests to predict the presence of heart disease, analyze model performance, and interpret feature importance.

## Tools & Libraries  
- Python  
- Pandas  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib  

## Summary of Steps  
- Loaded and explored the Heart Disease dataset, checked for missing values  
- Split dataset into features and target variable  
- Divided data into training (70%) and testing (30%) sets  
- Trained a Decision Tree Classifier and evaluated its accuracy  
- Visualized the trained Decision Tree structure  
- Trained a Random Forest Classifier and compared its accuracy with the Decision Tree  
- Interpreted feature importance from the Random Forest model  
- Performed 5-fold cross-validation to validate model robustness  

## Conclusion  
The project successfully applied tree-based classifiers for heart disease prediction, with the Random Forest model outperforming the Decision Tree in accuracy. Feature importance analysis provided insights on influential clinical parameters. Cross-validation confirmed model stability across different data splits.
